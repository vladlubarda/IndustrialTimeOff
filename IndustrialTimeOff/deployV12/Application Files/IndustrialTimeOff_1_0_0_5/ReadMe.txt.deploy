The "accrual "  you mention - Im not sure what you mean.    Each employee earns so many sick and or vacation days.    Nothing gets rolled over.   
Anything unused on the anniversary ( vacation days)  or new year ( sick days) gets paid out upon renewal.  
The probationary period is the 90 days wait for the first sick day allowed as I explain below for anyone's first year of hire.   
 
When the union year end (Oct 23rd) any sick days unused get paid out, and 6 more days are earned.   
For non-union, the sick days unused at Dec 31st get paid out, and 6 more sick days are earned as of the first of the year.   Sick and personal days are the same thing
 
There is a schedule as to vacation days and they are earned upon the hire date( or the anniversary date).  Any unused vacation days get paid out upon the anniversary .
 
after 1 year -     5  vacation days earned
after 2 yrs        10 days
after 8 yrs         15 days
after 11 yrs        16
after 12 yrs        17
after 13 yrs       18
after 14 yrs       19
after 15 yrs        20 vacation days earned
 
after 16 years and thereafter, 20 vacation days are earned each year. 
 
 
 The only other glitch is when a person is hired the first year.   They only earn their sick days  as follows:
after 90 days -  1 sick day earned
after 6 months  1 more sick day earned
after 9 months 1 more sick day earned
after 1 year another 3 days sick days earned ( this also depends when this is during the year- and gets confusing if it is near the end of the year for the non-union or the Oct 23rd date for union members).
